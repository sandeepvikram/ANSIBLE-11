#ANSIBLE DAY PRACTICE

CREATE 2 INSTANCES WITH UBUNTU 18( ANY VERSION IS FINE BUT HERE WE TOOK 18) 
LOGIN INTO THE SERVER
COMMANDS:
   ''' 
     sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
     PASSWORD AUTHENTICATION YES      (CHANGE PASSWD AUTH FROM NO TO YES)
     service sshd restart
   '''
NOW CREATE USER
'''
  sudo adduser devops                  (GIVE PASSWD AND ENTER FEW TIMES AND USER IS CREATED)
  sudo visudo                          ( CHANGE PERSMISSIONS TO GIVE ACCESS devops USER TO ACCESS  INSTANCE WITHOUT PEM FILE)
   '''     
     devops ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL    (ADD THIS COMMAND IN VISUDO IN SUDO COMMAND, WE ADD THIS COMMAND TO HAVE DEVOPS USER TO PERFORM COMMANDS WITHOUT THE PASSWORD AUTH EVERYTIME)

 NOW YOU CAN LOGIN TO INSTANCE WITH COMMAND
     ''' ssh devops@IP'''

 NOW DO THIS FOR NODE 1 AND NODE 2
 SO WE HAVE TOTAL 3 DEVOPS USERS IN ONE ANSIBLE CONTROL NODE AND 2 NODES

 ##NOW THAT WE CONFIGURED ALL THE NODES WE HAVE TO INSTALL ANSIBLE ON ANSIBLE CONTROL NODE###
    '''python --version'''
 ANSIBLE INSTALLATION COMMANDS FOR UBUNTU (SEARCH FOR OS SPECIFIC INSTALLATION )   
    '''$ sudo apt update
       $ sudo apt install software-properties-common
       $ sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
       $ sudo apt install ansible 

       ansible --version


  LOOK ONCE AT ANSIBLE CONFIG FILE
    ''' sudo vi  /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg'''


  NOW LETS CREATE A KEYS FOR ACCESSING NODES FROM ANSIBLE CONTROL NODE(ACN) 
     '''ssh-keygen'''
  COPY THE KEYGEN KEY PUBLIC KEY TO NODE WITH THEIR PRIVATE IP
    ''' ssh-copy-id devopss@IP
  WE DO THIS BECAUSE IT IS SECURE AND IF YOU OBSERVE WE DIDNT METIONED DEVOPSS WHILE COPYING ID TO NODE BECAUSE IT DIRECTLY RECOGNISES WE ARE DEVOPSS USER SO WE DONT DO NEED TO SPECIFY IT.

  CREATE HOSTS FILE AND GIVE PRIVATE IP's OF ALL THE NODES     

  ALWAYS RUN THE MANUAL STEPS BEFORE GOING TO RUN THE COMMANDS IN ANSIBLE (refer HEREhttps://directdevops.blog/2021/05/11/devops-classroom-series-11-may-2021/ )

  ###DAY 2###       
In this we will try to create a HOSTS FILE and create yml file WITH ANSIBLE COMMANDS

IN THE LINE 47 WE SEE A LINK TO INSTALL A SPRING BOOT APPLICATION NAMED SPRING PET CLINIC, AFTER WE HAVE EXECUTED MANUAL STEPS.
  1  sudo apt update
  2  sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y
  3  sudo mkdir /usr/share/springpetclinic
  4  wget https://referenceapplicationskhaja.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/spring-petclinic-2.4.2.jar
  5  sudo cp spring-petclinic-2.4.2.jar /usr/share/springpetclinic/
  6  sudo adduser springbootuser
  7  sudo chown springbootuser:springbootuser /usr/share/springpetclinic/spring-petclinic-2.4.2.jar
  8  sudo chmod 500 /usr/share/springpetclinic/spring-petclinic-2.4.2.jar
  9  sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/springpetclinic.service
 10  sudo systemctl enable springpetclinic.service
 11  sudo systemctl start springpetclinic.service
 12  sudo systemctl status springpetclinic.service

 FROM THIS MANUAL STEPS WE TRY TO CREATE ANSIBLE PLAYBOOK

### FROM LINUX M/C TO ACCESS GITHUB REPO USE GIT CLONE COMMAND AND TO GET THE LATEST CHANGES USE GIT PULL####

NOW WE DO WRITE A PART OF ANSIBLE PLAYBOOK AND EXECUTE IT.

############NOW WE HAVE SEEN A ERROR/REALIZATION THAT WHEN WE TRIED TO EXECUTE PLAYBOOK FROM THE UBUNTU CONTROL NODE IT THRE AN ERROR BECAUSE WE HAVE TO LOGIN INTO THE DEVOPS USER WE HAVE CREATED AND WE SHOULD EXECUTE THE STEPS.###############
############ALWAYS AFTER STOPPING AND STARTING THE CHECK THE COMMANDS BEFORE EXECUTING THE PLAYBOOKS I.E THE CONNECTION B/W NODES, SSH, SSH-KEYGEN, VERSIONS ETC##################
############ ANOTHER ERROR YOU ARE DOING IS AFTER EXECUTING THE PLAYBOOK FROM ANSIBLE CONTROL NODE YOU ARE EXITING THE INSTANCE AND TRYING TO SSH INTO NODE FOR OBSERVING CHANGES. BUT YOU SHOULD DIRECTLY LOGIN FROM THE ANSIBLE CONTROL NODE WITH '''SSH "PRIVATE IP"'''
########### ALWAYS LOGIN INTO DEVOPS USER WE HAVE CREATED BEFORE EXECUTING THE COMMANDS I.E '''ssh devops@"IP"'''

REFER THE NEXT STEPS OF CREATING A USER NAMED SPRINGBOOT (REFER https://github.com/sandeepvikram/ANSIBLE-11/commit/4557aa411fb67903e769088da642132c64bd3a02)
TO LOOK INTO THE USER CREATED LOGIN INTO NODE AND  
         '''cat /etc/passwd'''

NOW NEXT STEP IS TO CHANGE OWNERSHIP TO springbootuser (REFER https://github.com/sandeepvikram/ANSIBLE-11/commit/fe3f95c8408c37f30c720a4bc51ed18b9166987d)
AND TYPE '''ls -l /usr/share/springpetclinic''' to look into the change of OWNERSHIP.

NOW THE NEXT STEP IS TO CREATE A FILE NAMED springpetclinic.SERVICE AS IT IS THE WEB SERVICE. NOW IN THE MANUAL STEPS IN THE ABOVE LIST OF STEPS STEP 9 WE SEE HAVE CREATED A springpetclinic.SERVICE FILE WITH ''vi'' COMMAND 
AND IN ANSIBLE WE WILL CREATE IT IN THE ANSIBLE CONTROL NODE AND COPY IT INTO THE NODE EVERY TIME THE COMMANDS ANSIBLE PLAYBOOK IS EXECUTED(WHICH WE WILL SEE IN FUTURE THAT IS NOT A GOOD PRACTICE)

###DAY 3###
###VARIABLES(VARS)###:
IF WE OBSERVE "https://github.com/sandeepvikram/ANSIBLE-11/commit/fe3f95c8408c37f30c720a4bc51ed18b9166987d" THIS CODE WE SEE THAT WE HAVE DEFINED THE ALL THE INFORMATION IN A HARCODED FASHION I.E IF WE LOOK AT THE 
PACKAGE INSTALLED HERE JAVA 11 AND IF THERE IS A NEW VERSION IN FUTURE WE HAVE TO AGAIN CHANGE IT AND IN THE REAL LIFE THE CODE IS VERY LARGE AND COMPLEX SO WE DEFINE VARIABLES.
REFER HERE FOR VARIABLES "https://github.com/sandeepvikram/ANSIBLE-11/blob/master/Springboot%20Application/spc-deploy.yml"

WE HAVE ALSO SEEN THE ADDING OF DEBUG MESSAGES REFER
